# pokebattles

A pokemon game where you pick a pokemon and then it fights against other random pokemon.

Created in Vue, using VueX and [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

Roadmap:

- Day/Night mode toggle ✔️
- Search while selecting a pokemon card ✔️
- 3D Carousel to select a pokemon card ✔️
- Pokemon cards look similar to a real card
- Users can select a pokemon and battle another pokemon (Basic attacks) ✔️
- Some kind of "AI" that does more than attack ✔️ (kind of)
- Types and weaknesses/strengths work correctly
